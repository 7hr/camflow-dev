FINAL RESULTS:

./security/provenance/memcpy_ss.c:64:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
./security/provenance/include/provenance_record.h:251:  [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
  (CWE-120, CWE-20).
./security/provenance/include/provenance_task.h:177:  [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
  (CWE-120, CWE-20).
./security/provenance/include/provenance_task.h:195:  [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
  (CWE-120, CWE-20).
./security/provenance/include/provenance_task.h:201:  [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
  (CWE-120, CWE-20).
./security/provenance/relay.c:289:  [1] (port) snprintf:
  On some very old systems, snprintf is incorrectly implemented and permits
  buffer overflows; there are also incompatible standard definitions of it.
  Check it during installation, or use something else.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
